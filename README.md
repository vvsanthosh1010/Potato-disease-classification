# Potato Disease Classification Project

This project is aimed at classifying potato diseases using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images, and the code is contained within the `code` directory.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
# Install required Python libraries from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Navigate to the Code Directory

Move into the `code` directory where the Python scripts are located:

```bash
cd code
```

### 4. Run the Project

Run the Python script to train the classification model:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- **code/**: Contains the Python scripts for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Notes

Ensure that your Python environment is properly set up and all dependencies are installed before running the project.
